Hi there! My name is Limo, and I am a Full Stack Developer. I am currently studying Software Engineering in Kenya and am passionate about solving real-world problems faced by people in my community and across Africa.

I believe that every challenge presents an opportunity to learn and come up with innovative solutions. As a developer, I am committed to creating clean, efficient, and scalable code that is easy to maintain and update.


One of the most effective ways to keep up with changing technology is to actively participate in shaping it and make meaningful contributions. By doing so, you not only stay up-to-date with the latest advancements but also have the opportunity to influence their direction and help drive positive change.
